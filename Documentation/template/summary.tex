Virtual reality is cutting-edge technology where many industries are becoming interested in. The potential which virtual reality can bring to current lifestyles both in work and entertainment has helped in the boost of development for higher end virtual reality platforms. The University of Leeds regularly holes open days where prospective students come to the university and explore the many possibilities that the university has in store. The School of Computing at University of Leeds currently uses off the shelf software  with the current best virtual reality solution for consumers called HTC Vive. The problem that this project aims to solve is that the School of Computing requires a software that demonstrates computer science skills to create which takes advantage of virtual reality hardware.
