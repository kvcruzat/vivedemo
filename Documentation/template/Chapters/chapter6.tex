\section{Development Environment}
The development of this project was done in various environments, as there was many different aspects to this project.

\subsection{Vive Hardware}
	For this project, the Vive Hardware was set up in a dedicated room (The Virtual Reality Lab in the School of Computing). This allowed development to be done on the HTC Vive without having to set up the sensors and calibrate the hardware everytime that development had to be done, which maximised the amount of development time that was available.

	This room was chosen as it was unused and met the space requirements for the HTC Vive.
