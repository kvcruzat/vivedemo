We would like to thanks both Dr. Hamish Carr and Dr. Andy Bulpitt for all the guidance and advice they have provided to us throughout the project. Weekly meetings and thorough planning sessions were helpful towards the success of this project. The meetings inspired motivation and time to reflect on current progress on the project and an opportunity to discuss challenges faced.

We would also like to thank the School of Computing support staff especially Judi Drew for their help in granting access to the development room. They enabled us to work on the project whenever work was needed to be done.
